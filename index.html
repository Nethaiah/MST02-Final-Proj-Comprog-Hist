                    <p class="prog-lang-ans">A programming language is a vocabulary and grammatical system used to give instructions to a computer or other computing device so that it can carry out particular tasks. • The term programming language usually refers to high-level languages, such as BASIC, C, C++, COBOL, Java, FORTRAN, Ada, and Pascal. <br><br> The description of a programming language is usually split into the two components of syntax (form) and semantics (meaning), which are usually defined by a formal language. Some languages are defined by a specification document (for example, the C programming language is specified by an ISO Standard) while other languages (such as Perl) have a dominant implementation that is treated as a reference. Some languages have both, with the basic language defined by a standard and extensions taken from the dominant implementation being common.</p>

                    <p class="prog-lang-ans">The design of websites that are accessible online is known as web design. It covers a wide range of topics, such as search engine optimization, user interface design (UI design), and user experience design (UX design), among others. The creation and upkeep of a website require a variety of abilities and disciplines. <br><br> The term "web design" describes the layout of websites that are seen online. Instead of software development, it typically refers to the user experience aspects of website development. The primary focus of web design used to be creating websites for desktop browsers, but since the middle of the 2010s, designing for mobile and tablet browsers has gained significance. </p>

                            <p class="meaning">Because designers were forced to use black screens with pixels during this period of web design, it was called the "dark ages." In this mock-up of what Google might have looked like in the 1980s, you can see how designs were composed of symbols and tabulation (also known as the TAB key).</p>

                            <p class="meaning">Given his busy schedule, it's easy to understand why Berners-Lee is regarded as the father of web design. With the aid of his team, he established the first web page on August 6, 1991. This was a straightforward page with information about the World Wide Web that was hosted on a NeXT computer at the European Organization for Nuclear Research, or CERN.</p>

LiveScript, formerly known as Mocha, was created to enable Netscape website developers to automate behaviors in their web design. In essence, it converts a static page into a usable one so that users don't have to wait for a new page to load for each request. Interactive elements on websites, including drop-down menus and embedded forms, were made obsolete by the new scripting technology.</p>

                            <p class="meaning">CSS, a foundational piece of web design technology, was created in the late 1990s. This programming language, also referred to as Cascading Style Sheets, was developed in December 1996 by Hakon Wium Lie and Bert Bos. For the first time, the visual components (layouts, colors, and font) could be distinguished from the content (HTML). This gave website designers more freedom and power over how a website looked than ever before.</p>

The scientists typically work at universities and national laboratories in their home countries, though they frequently spend time at CERN. Therefore, having trustworthy communication tools is crucial.</p>

        <div class="web-development-pro">
            <p class="prog-lang-ans">In March 1989 and May 1990, respectively, Tim Berners-Lee produced the first and <a href="http://cds.cern.ch/record/369245/files/dd-89-001.pdf" target="_blank">second proposal</a> for the World Wide Web. Robert Cailliau, a Belgian systems engineer, and I formalized this as a <a href="http://cds.cern.ch/record/2639699/files/Proposal_Nov-1990.pdf" target="_blank">management proposal</a> in November 1990. The main ideas and key terms underlying the Web were outlined in this. The document described a "hypertext project" called "WorldWideWeb" in which "browsers" could view a "web" of "hypertext documents."<br><br> Tim Berners-Lee demonstrated his concepts by having the first Web server and browser operational at CERN by the year's end in 1990. On a NeXT computer, he wrote the code for his Web server. The computer was marked with a handwritten label in red ink that read: "This machine is a server. DO NOT POWER IT DOWN!!"</p>

            <p class="prog-lang-ans"><a href="http://info.cern.ch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">info.cern.ch</a> was the URL of the first website and Web server ever created, which was located on a NeXT computer at CERN.<br><br>In addition to a description of hypertext, technical information on building a Web server, and links to other Web servers as they became available, this page contained links to information about the WWW project itself.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="web-development-pro">
            <p class="prog-lang-ans">The WWW's layout made it simple to access already-existing data, and an <a href="http://info.cern.ch/NextBrowser.html" target="_blank">early web page</a> linked to data that CERN scientists could use (such as the CERN phone book and instructions for using the facility's main computers). There were no search engines in the early years, so a search facility relied on keywords. <br><br>On NeXT computers, Berners-Lee's original web browser demonstrated his vision and included many modern web browser features. It also featured the first Web editing feature: the ability to edit pages directly from within the browser. On a <a href="http://info.cern.ch/NextBrowser1.html">NeXT computer in 1993</a>, the browser can be seen open in this screenshot.</p>

        <h1 class="what-is-prog-lang">Becoming global</h1>
        <p class="prog-lang-ans"><a href="https://www.slac.stanford.edu/history/earlyweb/history.shtml" target="_blank">The Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC)</a> in California, another particle physics lab, hosted the first Web server in the US in December 1991, thanks to the efforts of Paul Kunz and Louise Addis. There were essentially only two types of browsers available at this time. One was the sophisticated original development version, which was only compatible with NeXT computers. The other was the 'line-mode' browser, which was simple to set up and use on any platform but had a low level of functionality and usability. The small CERN team was unable to complete the necessary work to advance the system, so Berners-Lee made an online appeal for additional programmers to join the effort. <br><br>The University of Illinois' <a href="https://www.ncsa.illinois.edu/" target="_blank">National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA)</a> debuted the first iteration of its Mosaic browser at the beginning of 1993. This program offered amiable window-based interaction and operated in the X Window System environment, which is well-liked in the research community. The NCSA soon after released versions for both the PC and Macintosh operating systems. The proliferation of the WWW was immediately impacted by the availability of dependable, user-friendly browsers on these widely used computers. On 30 April 1993, CERN made the source code of WorldWideWeb available on a royalty-free basis, making it free software. By late 1993 there were over 500 known web servers, and the WWW accounted for 1% of internet traffic, which seemed a lot in those days (the rest was remote access, e-mail and file transfer). 1994 was the “Year of the Web”. Initiated by Robert Cailliau, the <a href="http://www94.web.cern.ch/WWW94/Welcome0522.html" target="_blank">First International World Wide Web conference</a> was held at CERN in May. <a href="http://www94.web.cern.ch/WWW94/Welcome.html" target="_blank">It was attended by 380 users and developers</a>, and was hailed as the “Woodstock of the Web”. <br><br>As 1994 went on, news about the Web began to circulate. The International WWW Conference Committee (IW3C2) and the NCSA jointly organized a second conference in the US in October, which drew 1300 attendees. The Web had 10,000 servers, 2000 of which were commercial, and 10,000,000 users by the end of 1994. Traffic was equivalent to shipping the entire collected works of Shakespeare every second. Technology was continuously improved to meet evolving needs. Security and tools for e-commerce were the most important features soon to be added.</p>

            <details>
                <summary>What is Wed Development?<span class="material-icons" id="summary">expand_more</span></summary>
                <p>Web development, also known as website development, refers to the tasks associated with creating, building, and maintaining websites and web applications that run online on a browser. It may, however, also include web design, web programming, and database management.</p>

            <details>
                <summary>What is Web Developer?<span class="material-icons" id="summary">expand_more</span></summary>
                <p>A web developer is a programmer who makes websites, and apps for the World Wide Web. A web developer builds a website from the bottom up, developing everything from layout to functions and features on the page.</p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>What is Web Design?<span class="material-icons" id="summary">expand_more</span></summary>
                <p>The design of websites that are accessible online is known as web design. It covers a wide range of topics, such as search engine optimization, user interface design (UI design), and user experience design (UX design), among others. The creation and upkeep of a website require a variety of abilities and disciplines. <br><br> The term "web design" describes the layout of websites that are seen online. Instead of software development, it typically refers to the user experience aspects of website development. The primary focus of web design used to be creating websites for desktop browsers, but since the middle of the 2010s, designing for mobile and tablet browsers has gained significance.</p>

                <summary>Are a web developer and a web designer the same thing?<span class="material-icons" id="summary">expand_more</span></summary>
                <p>A <strong>web developer</strong> is more concerned with functionality and features of a website, and versed in the programming languages required to create them. Web developers will still need to understand the aesthetics and art direction of the site as they implement features.
                <br><br> A <strong>web designer</strong> will create the logos, graphics, and layout that determine the look and feel of a website. Web designers will use software like Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator to create these materials. A web designer with a knowledge of code can help him/her better communicate with the web developer.</p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>What are types of Web developer?<span class="material-icons" id="summary">expand_more</span></summary>
                <p> There are three kinds of web developer specialization: <br><br> <strong>Front-end developers</strong> are responsible for behaviour and visuals that run in the user browser. <br><br> <strong>Back-end developers</strong> deal with the servers. <br><br> <strong>Full-stack developers</strong> are responsible for both.</p>
